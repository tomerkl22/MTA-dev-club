MTA Frontend assignment - react

Hey, 
I tried my best without any knowledge about React...
It was not the best but I have something that more work and knowledge will solve.
I started with my own List data and it worked (so I uploaded it as well).
In App.js you can see fetch to the API...
Hope you like it (-:
